To implement the style transfer I took the follow steps/ used the following resources: 

1. First, I followed the ml5 documentation for training a style transfer model in tensorflow, found [here](https://github.com/ml5js/training-styletransfer)

I found I didn't have the processing power to do this (it would have taken days), so I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gye9hSIrRWI) tutorial by Yining Shi in order to train a model using a virtual machine (Spell). This process took a few hours (first, to create the environment and dataset on Spell, next to train the dataset on an image to produce a style model).

The model is trained on the COCO2014 largescale dataset and VGG19 optimizer function. 

2. After training the model in Spell, I took the ckpt files that were generated for use in tensorflow.py and converted them to use in tensorflow.js using [this repository](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs)

3. The next step was to use this model in an p5.js sketch, which I did following the documentation on the ml5 website. All of the examples on the site use either webcam input or pre-loaded server-side files as input, so I needed to figure out how to apply the model to images that were scraped from the web. I created a test sketch to make sure the model was working properly, using webcam input

4. I configured the Bing API to directly query image search results from my sketch. I scraped the JSON in order to acquire the top 12 results for the search "nude" (safe search off).

5. Parsing the JSON is difficult, becuase of the way that p5.js renders p5.images. I thought I would have to write something to temp download images and refer to the local files, but I eventually got it to work by using the createImg() in a series of callback function. This doesn't work if CORS is enabled and security features are temporarily disabled. 

6. I first generated a lot of pixel distortion, but eventually figured out the model was looking for a very specific size and scale of input and reference images.

## next steps 


1. Implement it in client. Right now, I am getting several uncaught js errors that have to be resolved. [See here](http://www.rebeccauliasz.com/synthetic-sage/)

2. Implement similar idea with GAN. This will require more computational power than I have right now
